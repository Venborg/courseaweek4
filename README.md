## The process have been the following:
1. Reading the datasets, lables, features, test(x,y) and train(x,y) and subject for both train and test
2. Next the column names are unified
3. The datasets are combined and the features are added as the column names and labels are replacing the activtity numberes
4. The mean() and std() columns are extracted and combined and reordered
5. The column names are made more or less readble in the orginal combined dataset
6. Extracting a "tidy" dataset based on the mean and sorted according to the subject/participants
